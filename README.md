# ZEAL 1.0

Welcome to **ZEAL**, my first game developed using Unity! This is a game that is even simpler than it seems. Your only goal will be to kidnap the space shuttle we control from the alien. The alien's movements are completely random (it can change direction as it goes) and has a constant speed. The game starts very quickly as soon as "Start" is pressed, so you have to be very fast too.

## Development Status

- **Current Stage**: Beta
- The game is currently in the beta stage. It is playable but still undergoing improvements and bug fixes. Your feedback is highly appreciated to help enhance the game.

## Future Plans

- **Level System**: Adding new and more challenging levels.
- **Timer**: A counter will be implemented that shows how long you survived.
- **Point System**: A scoring system will be designed based on survival time or time to finish the level.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or find any bugs, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Using "**W,A,S,D**" keys on 2 dimensional plane.

## Feedback
